# Task Domain Adaptation method for data selection

## First step

Data preprocessing for further use. As this code implementation expects the input data as jsonl format

## Second step

Train vampire model (exactly the encoder and decoder) based on different data source

## Third step

Get embeddings result through **get_embedding.py** file, and then you can select data instance by these embeddings
